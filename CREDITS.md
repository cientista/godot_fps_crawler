Stock by BirdseyeStock - Terms of Use
=====================================

All stock textures offered as free for use to members of Deviantart.com, subject to the rest of the terms below:


What IS allowed
---------------
No need to ask first, you HAVE my permission to:
 o  use these textures as part of your own artwork
 o  offer your own artwork as a Print
 o  use these textures in commercial artwork
 o  use these textures for private purposes such as school projects, desktop wallpaper, card making etc.
 o  submit your own artwork to another website or gallery


What is NOT allowed
-------------------
You must NOT:
 o  use this stock for images portraying pornography, racism, violence or hatred of any kind
 o  sell, redistribute, upload or offer any of these stock textures on other sites, galleries, blogs etc.
 o  copy or alter these textures, in an effort to disguise their origin and claim it as your own work. That's low and dishonest, don't do it!
 o  use these textures to make other stock material


Credit where credit is due
--------------------------
If you use a stock texture please acknowledge my creative efforts and do the following:
 o  you MUST acknowledge your source material in the artist comments below your deviation, together with a link to the texture pack deviation and/or to me: ~BirdseyeStock
 o  leave a comment or note me with a link to your deviation, I like to see what people have done
 o  add the stock deviation to your DA faves so others can find and enjoy them too
 o  for artwork outside DeviantArt please credit your sources and note me with a link
 o  if you think something is cool then by all means tell your friends and share it online but do so by *linking* to the original deviation rather than copying the images elsewhere. Thanks!


Questions?
----------
For any other questions regarding usage, please ask first! I will probably be happy to oblige.


I hope you agree that these terms of use are fair and reasonable. 
Thank you for respecting and honoring my wishes. 
Now go and be creative (and show me your work afterwards)! :D
